# rrythm

## What Is It?
rrythm first started off as a clone to Discord's famous [Rythm music bot](https://rythm.fm/). After starting a version 2 of the project, I moved away from the idea of just making this project a clone by adding my interpertation of what a modernized version would look like, had Rythm never shut down in the first place. This is my first major project where I overcame many milestones and adversities, which greatly kickstarted my passion into programming and creating things in general.

## Why Did I Make This?
Ever since Rythm was shut down (during a global pandemic), I noticed that all of my friends stopped hanging around in voice channels as much anymore. In the past, they would hang around in voice channels until very late, listening to music using the bot. In hopes for a programming challenge and to bring back the past, I decided to tackle on making a Discord bot without much prior knowledge to the process. 

## Features Of This Project
* Modular code organization and structure for easy maintenance accomplished through `fs`
* Interactive Discord bot that is capable of playing music using a media stream from YouTube  
* Created classes (i.e., `MusicPlayer`, `Discord`, `YouTubeStream`) to enable reusable code to be more accessible

## Things I Learned While Making This Project
* How to read and follow documentation
* How to organize code and create a GitHub repository
* The process of cloing an existing application
* How to host this on my own Raspberry Pi
* How to use getters to read object data for logic flow

## Packages I used
* Discord.js
* Discord.js/voice (and other packages for audio optimization)
* play-dl

## Future Ideas
* A command to shuffle the queue, similar to what Rythm could do
* Lyrics feature
* Implement slash commands, as it is the modern way to interact with Discord bots
